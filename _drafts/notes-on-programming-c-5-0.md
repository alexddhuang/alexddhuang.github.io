[*Programming C# 5.0: Building Windows 8, Web, and Desktop Applications for the .NET 4.5 Framework*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024064.do) (2012) by [Ian Griffiths](https://blogs.endjin.com/author/ian-griffiths/).

## Chapter 1. Introducing C#

### Why C#?

- C# supports object-oriented features, generics, and functional programming.
- C# supports both dynamic and static typing.
- C# provides powerful list- and set-oriented features, thanks to [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/using-linq).
- The most recent version adds intrinsic support for asynchronous programming.
- C# has a high-quality platform: [the .Net Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). It includes a runtime (CLR) and the library. CLR provides security sandboxing, runtime type checking, exception handling, thread management, and garbage collection.
