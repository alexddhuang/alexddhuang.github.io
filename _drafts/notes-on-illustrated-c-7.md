[*Illustrated C# 7*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484232879) by Daniel Solis and Cal Schrotenboer is the 5th edition of *Illustrated C#*, and was published in 2018.

## Why .Net?

Before C#, there were three technologies for Windows programming:

1. The raw Win32 API -- not object-oriented.
2. Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) -- object-oriented, but inconsistent and getting old.
3. Component Object Model (COM) -- complex, ugly, and inelegant.

Another shortcoming is that they were aimed at desktop programming rather than Web programming. So .Net was designed.
