[Mark Lutz](https://learning-python.com/)'s [*Learning Python*, 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449355730) was published in 2013. I chose it as my first book for learning Python. All source code from this book can be found in this repo: [learning-python-5e](https://github.com/alexddhuang/learning-python-5e).

## Chapter 1. A Python Q&A Session

### Why Do People Use Python?

#### Software Quality

- Simple and readable syntax
- A highly coherent programming model

#### Developer Productivity

> Its simple syntax, dynamic typing, lack of compile steps, and built-in toolset allow programmers to develop programs in a fraction of the time needed when using some other tools.

## Chapter 2. How Python Runs Programs

### Program Execution

#### Pythonâ€™s View

When you run a program, Python first compile your source code into *byte code*. In 3.2 and later,Python saves byte code files in a subdirectory named `__pycache__`.
