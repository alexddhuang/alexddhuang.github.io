## About this Book

> We are about to study the idea of a *computational process*. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called *data*. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a *program*.

This book uses [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) as the language for describing programs. The reason why the authors of this book chose Lisp is one of its features: *Procedures* can themselves be represented and manipulated as *data*. In modern words, it's said that procedures in Lisp are the [first-class citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen).
