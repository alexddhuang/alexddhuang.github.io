[Peter Lax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lax)'s [*Linear Algebra and Its Applications*, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471751561), published in 2007.

## Chapter 1. Fundamentals

This book takes an abstract view of vector spaces. This book is a good preparation for functional analysis.

A *vector space X* over a *field K* is a set in which two operations are defined. They are *addition* and *multiplication*.

-------

> EXERCISE 1. Show that the zero of vector addition is unique.

Suppose there are two zeros of vector $\vec{0}$ and $\vec{0}'$, then we have $\vec{0} + \vec{0}' = \vec{0}$ and $\vec{0}' + \vec{0} = \vec{0}'$, and because of the *commutative law* of vector additions, we have

$$
\vec{0} + \vec{0}' = \vec{0}' + \vec{0} \Rightarrow \vec{0} = \vec{0}'
$$
