[Peter Lax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lax)'s [*Linear Algebra and Its Applications*, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471751561), published in 2007.

## Chapter 1. Fundamentals

This book takes an abstract view of vector spaces. This book is a good preparation for functional analysis.

> EXERCISE 1. Show that the zero of vector addition is unique.

Suppose there are two zeros $0$ and $0'$, then we have $0 + 0' = 0$ and $0' + 0 = 0'$, and because of the *commutative law* of vector additions, we have

$$
0 + 0' = 0' + 0 \Rightarrow 0 = 0'
$$
