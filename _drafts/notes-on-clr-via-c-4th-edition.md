### Chapter 1. The CLRâ€™s Execution Model

#### Compiling Source Code into Managed Modules

> A *managed module* is a standard 32-bit Windows portable executable (PE32) file or a standard 64-bit Windows portable executable (PE32+) file that requires the CLR to execute.

There are four parts in a managed module:

- PE32 or PE32+ header
- CLR header
- Metadata
- IL code

An *assembly* is a logical grouping of one or more managed modules or resource files. An assembly is the smallest unit of reuse, security, and versioning.

#### Loading the Common Language Runtime
