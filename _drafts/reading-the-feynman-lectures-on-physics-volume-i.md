[*The Feynman Lectures on Physics*](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) is based upon a course of lectures in introductory physics given by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) at the California Institute of Technology during the academic year 1961–62. [The Volume I](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_toc.html) is mainly on mechanics, radiation, and heat.

## Chapter 1. Atoms in Motion

### 1–1 Introduction

### 1–2 Matter is made of atoms

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the **atomic hypothesis** (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

Atoms are 1 or 2 *angstroms* ($\AA$, $10^{-10}m$) in radius.

### 1–3 Atomic processes
### 1–4 Chemical reactions

## Chapter 2. Basic Physics
