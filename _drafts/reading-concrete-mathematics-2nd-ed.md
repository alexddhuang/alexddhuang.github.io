Here are some notes on the book [*Concrete Mathematics*, 2nd Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics) (1994) by [Ronald Graham](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/ron/), [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/), and [Oren Patashnik](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/p/Patashnik:Oren). 

Is it a word game? The "Concrete" on the title of this book is a blend of CONtinuous and disCRETE. 

> More concretely, it is the controlled manipulation of mathematical formulas, using a collection of techniques for solving problems.

> The major topics treated in this book include sums, recurrences, elementary number theory, binomial coefficients, generating functions, discrete probability, and asymptotic methods.

## 1. Recurrent Problems

### 1.1 The Tower of Hanoi

We are given a tower of $n$ disks, initially stacked in decreasing size on one of three pegs. The objective is to transfer the entire tower to one of the other pegs, moving only one disk at a time and never moving a larger one onto a smaller. The question is **how many moves are necessary and sufficient to perform the task**?

Let $T_n$ be the minimum number of moves that will transfer $n$ disks from one peg to another under [Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Lucas)'s rule. For transfering $n$ disks from peg A to peg B, we have to transfer the first $n-1$ disks from A to C, and then move the last disk from A to B, and finally move the $n-1$ disks from C to B. So the sum moves are

$$
T_n = 2T_{n-1} + 1
$$

Combining this formula with the case $T_0=0$, we finally have

$$
T_n = 2^{n} - 1
$$

### 1.2 Lines in the Plane

What is the maximum number $L_n$ of regions defined by $n$ lines in the plane?

The $n$-th line (for $n > 0$) increases the number of regions by $k$ if and only if it splits $k$ of the old regions, and it splits $k$ old regions if and only if it hits the previous lines in $k âˆ’ 1$ different places. So we get

$$
L_n = L_{n-1} + n
$$

Combining this formula with the case $L_0=1$, we finally have

$$
L_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1
$$

### 1.3 The Josephus Problem

We start with n people numbered 1 to n around a circle, and we eliminate every second remaining person until only one survives. We note the survivor's number as $J(n)$.

Suppose that we have $2n$ people, after the first go-round, we're left with

If we renumber these people from 1 to n and continue the next round, we can get this relation:

$$
J(2n) = 2J(n) - 1
$$

Suppose that we have $2n+1$ people, after the first go-round, we're left with

{% include image.html name="josephus-2n+1.png" width="30%" %}

Similarly, we get that

$$
J(2n+1) = 2J(n) + 1
$$
