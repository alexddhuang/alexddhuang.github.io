Here are my notes on [Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/)'s [*Analysis I*, 3rd Edition](http://www.hindbook.com/index.php/analysis-i-3-e) (2017).

## Chapter 2. Starting at the beginning: the natural numbers

> One skill in particular that you will pick up here is the use of mathematical induction, which is a basic tool in proving things in many areas of mathematics.

### 2.1 The Peano axioms

This axioms system was invented by [Giuseppe Peano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano).

> Axiom 2.1. 0 is a natural number.

> Axiom 2.2. If n is a natural number, then n++ is also a natural number.

> Axiom 2.3. 0 is not the successor of any natural number; i.e., we have $n++ \neq 0$ for every natural number n.
