[Ellan Jiang](https://github.com/EllanJiang)'s [Unity GameFramework](https://github.com/EllanJiang/GameFramework) is a popular (1400+ stars on GitHub on September 2019) and elegant framework for Unity game programmer. I want to walk through the codebase and take some notes on it. I think this is a good way to learn it.
